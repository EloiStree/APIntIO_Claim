# APIntIO_Claim

To use the APIntIO default server for tournaments or as an official user, you need a key claim.  
See [https://github.com/EloiStree/2025_01_01_HelloMegaMaskPiServer](https://github.com/EloiStree/2025_01_01_HelloMegaMaskPiServer) for context.  
Buy a key: [https://buymeacoffee.com/apintio](https://buymeacoffee.com/apintio)

Find here only folders representing an index and files representing the index owner.

Note, all the index to public key is store on my servers as such:     
`git clone https://github.com/EloiStree/APIntIO_Claim.git /git/APIntIO_Claim`  

By my convention: 
- `0` is the admin for `twitch play` like project.  
- `42` is the admin of the server.
