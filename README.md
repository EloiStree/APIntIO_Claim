# APIntIO_Claim

To use the APIntIO default server for tournaments or as an official user, you need a key claim.  
See [https://github.com/EloiStree/2025_01_01_HelloMegaMaskPiServer](https://github.com/EloiStree/2025_01_01_HelloMegaMaskPiServer) for context.  
Buy a key: [https://buymeacoffee.com/apintio](https://buymeacoffee.com/apintio)

Find here only folders representing an index and files representing the index owner.

Note, all the index to public key is store on my servers as such:     
`git clone https://github.com/EloiStree/APIntIO_Claim.git /git/APIntIO_Claim`  

By my convention: 
- `0` is the admin for `twitch play` like project.  
- `42` is the admin of the server.  


**To add a key:**

- Buy a key at [https://buymeacoffee.com/apintio](https://buymeacoffee.com/apintio).
- Contact me with an unclaimed index you want to use and the public key you'd like to associate with it.
  - Once added: "Own the key, own the index" is the only rule. Donâ€™t lose it.
  - I recommend using MetaMask for that key to avoid losing it.
  - This master key is use to forge authorized keys on : Discord, Twitch, Unity3D and others. 

**Monthly Cost and Ethereum Ranking:**

The key serves as a claim index authentication to access APIntIO's default servers and services.
- If the project grows and evolves into a service with a monthly cost, this key grants access to it.
- When we organize coding tournaments, this master key is used to receive the prize.
